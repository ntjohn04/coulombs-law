##DESCRIPTION

A JavaFX program that allows the user to create arrangements of spherical charged objects.
Electric forces are calculated by treating spheres as point charges. Options for point charges include
custom charge magnitude, custom spherical radius, enabling elastic collisions,
tethering to limit movement to a certain radius, enabling Earth-like gravity, 
and disabling the bounds on the edges of the program screen.
